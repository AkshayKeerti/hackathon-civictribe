## 🎯 Project Overview

**CivicScribe** is an AI-powered web application that transforms complex government forms into conversational, user-friendly experiences. Instead of struggling with confusing bureaucratic language, users simply answer natural questions, and CivicScribe automatically fills out the official forms for them.

### The Problem We're Solving
- **70%** of users abandon government forms due to complexity
- **Accessibility barriers** prevent vulnerable populations from accessing services
- **Language barriers** make forms impossible for non-native speakers
- **Digital literacy gaps** exclude elderly and low-income users

### Our Solution
A conversational web app that guides users through form completion using natural language, automatically retrieves official forms, and generates submission-ready documents.

## 📊 Demo Script

### **Opening** (30 seconds):
"Government forms are broken. They're confusing, inaccessible, and cause 70% of users to give up. Meet CivicScribe - the first conversational form assistant."

### **Problem Demo** (30 seconds):
"Here's a typical food assistance form. Look at this language - 'household composition verification' - what does that even mean?"

### **Solution Demo** (3 minutes):
"Now watch CivicScribe transform this experience. Instead of complex fields, we ask simple questions: 'How many people live in your home?' The AI understands your answers and fills out the official form automatically."

### **Results** (1 minute):
"In 3 minutes, we've completed what would normally take 30 minutes and cause frustration. The user gets a submission-ready PDF and clear next steps."
